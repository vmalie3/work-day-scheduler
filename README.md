## Description


I created a work day scheduler where you can locally store events for different times of the day. The current date is always displayed at the top of the page, followed by a table which includes one section per hour from 9AM to 5PM. The rows of these tables include a text area and a save button, which saves the inputed text into local storage. The hourly rows also change colors based on the current time.
